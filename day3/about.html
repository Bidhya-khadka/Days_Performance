  <h1>The components Of A Great About Us Page</h1>
  <p>There isn’t a winning template to create a great About Us page. However, there are key components to make a convincing
  pitch with your brand story.</p>

  <h2>Your Mission</h2>
  <p>You don’t need to outright say, “our mission is ____,” but you should convey the mission of your business in your About
  Us copy. This is key for attracting talent, as well as leads that have Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) goals.</p>

  <h2>Your Services (And Benefits)</h2>
  <p>Of course, you have a homepage and dedicated pages for your products, but summarizing your offerings on the About Us
  page is crucial to tie them in with brand values in your messaging. Highlight the benefits and showcase what you do (and why it is unique).</p>
